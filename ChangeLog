0.2 - 2009-08-06
 * Significantly improved worker and client performance.
 * Fixed bug #400466. (Client leaks memory when submitting attached jobs).
   Removed method selectUpdatedJobEvents from GearmanClient.Java interface 
   (and underlying implementations). There was no clean way to make this
   method work without leaking memory. Users who wish to handle events can
   still do so by simply attaching a listener to the job.
 * Added build support for pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, and code coverage (emma).

0.1 - 2009-07-16
 * First release.
