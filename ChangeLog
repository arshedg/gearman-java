0.03 - 2009-XX-XX
 * Cleanup findbugs, pmd, and checkstyle warnings
 * Changed signature of the addServerMethod in GearmanClient and
   GearmanWorker (as well as their implementations) to return a
   boolean to indicate success or failure of attempt. Attmepts to
   add a server that can not be contacted will now return false as
   opposed to throwing a runtime exception.
 * ClientImpl driveRequestTillState now drivesIO on all sessions that
   are selected for IO instead of driving IO for only the session to
   which the request belongs.

0.02 - 2009-08-06
 * Significantly improved worker and client performance.
 * Fixed bug #400466. (Client leaks memory when submitting attached jobs).
   Removed method selectUpdatedJobEvents from GearmanClient.Java interface 
   (and underlying implementations). There was no clean way to make this
   method work without leaking memory. Users who wish to handle events can
   still do so by simply attaching a listener to the job.
 * Added build support for pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, and code coverage (emma).

0.01 - 2009-07-16
 * First release.
