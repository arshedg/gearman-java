0.04 - 2010-XX-XX
 * Fixed bug 511489, checking the status of a failed job incorrectly
   returns true.
 * Refactored tests.

0.03 - 2009-09-16
 * Cleanup findbugs, pmd, and checkstyle warnings
 * Misc. build improvements
   - build will look for property definitions in 
     ~/.ant/gearman-java.build.properties
   - generate all reports in xml or 'text' depending on whether 
     gearman-java.reports.text property is set.
 * Changed signature of the addServerMethod in GearmanClient and
   GearmanWorker (as well as their implementations) to return a
   boolean to indicate success or failure of attempt. Attmepts to
   add a server that can not be contacted will now return false as
   opposed to throwing a runtime exception.
 * ClientImpl driveRequestTillState now drivesIO on all sessions that
   are selected for IO instead of driving IO for only the session to
   which the request belongs.
 * Allow gearman functions to control the name that will be used to 
   register the function with the server when using the default 
   function factory (factory was ignoring the name of the funciton 
   and always registering function with its class name).
 * Fixed bug #417004 (ReverseClient example shows improper use of 
   client).
 * Fixed bug #417214 (Worker performs slow on linux).
   client). Connection between worker and job server did not
   have TCP_NODELAY set, causing performance problems on linux.
   Changed connection settings to mirror settings in libgearmand.
 * Fixed bug #417208 (AbstractGearmanFunction does not correctly
   handle failing or misbehaving functions). Fix resulted in
   changing the signature for GearmanFunction interface. The 
   GearmanFunction interface now extends Callable<GearmanJobResult>,
   clients of this interface will need to be changed to reflect this.
 * Fixed bug #418927. We can now send a receive payloads larger then
   the default buffer sizes.

0.02 - 2009-08-06
 * Significantly improved worker and client performance.
 * Fixed bug #400466. (Client leaks memory when submitting attached jobs).
   Removed method selectUpdatedJobEvents from GearmanClient.Java interface 
   (and underlying implementations). There was no clean way to make this
   method work without leaking memory. Users who wish to handle events can
   still do so by simply attaching a listener to the job.
 * Added build support for pmd, findbugs, checkstyle, and code coverage (emma).

0.01 - 2009-07-16
 * First release.
